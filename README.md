## Welcome to the BLT Report

The mission of this project is to review each and every one of Python's built-in's. [Dunders included](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5lW_fRD0F0).

Also known as the "**Built-In Report**," the mascot for this project is the **B**acon, **L**ettuce and **T**omato Sandwich. (*)

(i.e. One must tolerate such whimsicals. -Certainly for a project helping Pythoneers master the world's most popular programming language ... named after ***Monty Python***?)

## Video Creations

Videos are now available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgnu7Nz4d3M&t=21s).

## PyQuest Cards

New cards are part of the [PyQuest Card Game](https://github.com/Python3-Training/PyQuest/tree/main/CardGame).

Enjoy!
