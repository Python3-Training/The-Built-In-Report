## Welcome to the BLT Report

The mission of this project is to review each and every one of Python's built-in's.

Also known as the "**Built-In Report**," the mascot for this project is the **B**acon, **L**ettuce and **T**omato Sandwich. 

(i.e. One must tolerate such whimsicals. -Certainly for a project helping Pythoneers master the world's most popular programming language ... named after ***Monty Python***?)
