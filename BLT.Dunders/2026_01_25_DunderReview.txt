Generative: what is the complete list of dunders in pythonAI OverviewPython includes a large number of "dunder" (double underscore) methods and attributes that allow for extensive customization of class behavior and interaction with built-in language features. A complete, organized list is available in the official Python documentation's Data Model page; a comprehensive community-maintained list of the most common ones is below. ( https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html )Core Dunder Methods by Category    Initialization and Destruction        __new__: Called to create a new instance.        __init__: Called to initialize the new instance after it's created.        __del__: Called when the instance is about to be destroyed (destructor).        __init_subclass__: Called when a class is subclassed.        __prepare__: Used to customize the class's initial namespace dictionary.    Representation        __repr__: Provides an official string representation, typically for developers (repr()).        __str__: Provides a "pretty" or user-friendly string representation (str(), print()).        __bytes__: Implements behavior for bytes().        __format__: Customizes string formatting for f-strings and format().    Comparison        __lt__ (less than, <)        __le__ (less than or equal to, <=)        __eq__ (equal to, ==)        __ne__ (not equal to, !=)        __gt__ (greater than, >)        __ge__ (greater than or equal to, >=)        __hash__: Used for hash() and allowing objects to be dictionary keys or set members.    Attribute Access        __getattr__: Fallback for when a requested attribute is not found.        __getattribute__: Called for every attribute access.        __setattr__: Called when setting an attribute value.        __delattr__: Called when deleting an attribute.        __dir__: Customizes the output of dir() on the object.    Container and Iteration        __len__: Returns the length of the container (len()).        __length_hint__: Provides a length estimate for optimization.        __getitem__: Retrieves an item (obj[key]).        __setitem__: Sets an item (obj[key] = value).        __delitem__: Deletes an item (del obj[key]).        __missing__: Handles missing keys in dict subclasses.        __iter__: Returns an iterator for the container (iter(), for loops).        __reversed__: Implements behavior for reversed().        __contains__: Implements membership testing (in operator).    Numeric Operations        Binary operators: __add__, __sub__, __mul__, __matmul__, __truediv__, __floordiv__, __mod__, __divmod__, __pow__, __lshift__, __rshift__, __and__, __xor__, __or__ (and their __r...__ right-hand and __i...__ in-place versions).        Unary operators: __neg__, __pos__, __abs__, __invert__.        Type conversion: __int__, __float__, __complex__, __bool__, __index__.        Math functions: __round__, __trunc__, __floor__, __ceil__.    Context Managers        __enter__: Enters the runtime context (with statement).        __exit__: Exits the runtime context.    Asynchronous Programming        __await__: Implements awaitable objects.        __aiter__: Returns an asynchronous iterator.        __anext__: Returns the next awaitable item from an async iterator.        __aenter__: Enters the asynchronous context manager.        __aexit__: Exits the asynchronous context manager.    Other        __call__: Allows an instance to be called as a function (obj()).        __instancecheck__: Implements isinstance(obj, Class).        __subclasscheck__: Implements issubclass(Subclass, Class). This list focuses on the methods that can be overridden in custom classes; other dunder names exist as built-in attributes (e.g., __name__, __file__, __doc__) that store information rather than implement behavior.
